# LoanSetu – Internal AI Workflow Assistant

LoanSetu is an experimental AI assistant designed to reduce manual effort in business-loan discovery and internal support workflows.

## Why this exists
Financial institutions rely on employees to repeatedly answer:
- eligibility questions
- scheme clarifications
- documentation rules

These interactions are repetitive, error-prone, and time-consuming at scale.

## What this project demonstrates
- Problem-first AI design
- Rule + LLM hybrid approach
- Session-based conversation flow
- Extendable architecture for other internal tools

## Not a finished product
This is a working prototype meant to showcase how similar tools can be built for different operational workflows.

## Tech
- Node.js
- Express
- LLM (Groq)
- Rule-based parsing
